# Handling Duplicate Values in Power BI

![Handling Duplicate Values in Power BI](https://github.com/preetparmar/PowerBI-Mini-Projects/blob/main/Handling%20Duplicate%20Customer%20Names/Resources/Screenshot/Screenshot.png)

- In this example I will go over a better way to handle duplicate values in Power BI.
- The idea is that if we add Zero-width space to the desired names, then it will look the same to the human eye but for Power BI it will have two different names so it will not end up aggregating measures for them.
